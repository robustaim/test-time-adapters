Pluggable Test-time Adapter Implementations

> This repository suggests a pluggable implementation of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) module.

> It is designed to be easily integrated into existing Transformer-family models, enhancing their capabilities to adapt during inference time under the distribution shift.
